You should see ``19'' in the log window. That is the length of this file name. So in this example string, index starts from 0 and the last index is 18.

Next, we use the function \ilcom{substring(string, index1, index2)}. With this function, you could extract part of the \ilcom{string} by giving the start index (index1) and the end index (index2) as arguments. We could just try this by again modifying the code above.
