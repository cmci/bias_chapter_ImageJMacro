\subsection{User-defined Functions}

As your code becomes longer, 
you will start to realize that similar processing or 
calculation appears several times in a macro or through macro sets. 
To simplify such redundancy, one could write a 
separate \ilcom{function} that works as a module for macros. 
For example, if you have a simple code like:
