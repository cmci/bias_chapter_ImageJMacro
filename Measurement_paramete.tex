Modify code 10 to include more measurement parameters (whatever you like), and test the macro. Check the results. 

\item \textbf{Answer}:``Set Measurement'' could be added with more parameters to be measured, and the digits after the decimal point could be increased by increasing the number after ``decimal=''. For example, 
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
run("Set Measurements...", "area mean standard modal min centroid center perimeter bounding integrated median stack redirect=None decimal=5");
\end{lstlisting}
