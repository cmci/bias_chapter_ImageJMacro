Then in the bottom-left corner of the script editor, there is a button labeled "Run". Clicking this, you will see that a log window is created (if it is already there, then it will have a new line) printing "Hello World!" (Figure \ref{fig_HelloWorldLog}). Another way to run the macro is via Script Editor menu,  \ijmenu{[Run -> Run]} . You could use Ctrl-R (Windows) or Command-R (OSX) as well.
