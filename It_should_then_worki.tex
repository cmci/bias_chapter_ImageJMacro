Let's change our task: We now want to know the time point that this image was taken. How should we do that? Examining the file name again, we realize that the time point number appears after ``T''. The number could be any length of digits, but currently is 0. Then the dot comes right after the number.

Therefore we find the index of ``\_T'' that looks like more specific.
